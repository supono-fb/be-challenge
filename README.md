# Backend Developer Coding Challenge

## Objective
Build a RESTful API for a task management application with advanced features. The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, as well as manage user roles and permissions. Each task should have a title, description, status, due date, and assigned user. The API should be built using Node.js, TypeScript, Docker, and Firebase.

## Requirements
1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
   - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
   - `GET /tasks/:id`: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
   - `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update a specific task by ID.
   - `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a specific task by ID.
   - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
   - `GET /users`: Retrieve all users.
   - `GET /users/:id`: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
   - `PUT /users/:id`: Update a specific user by ID.
   - `DELETE /users/:id`: Delete a specific user by ID.
   - `POST /roles`: Create a new role.
   - `GET /roles`: Retrieve all roles.
   - `GET /roles/:id`: Retrieve a specific role by ID.
   - `PUT /roles/:id`: Update a specific role by ID.
   - `DELETE /roles/:id`: Delete a specific role by ID.

2. **Task Model**:
   - `id`: string (auto-generated by Firebase)
   - `title`: string
   - `description`: string
   - `status`: string (e.g., "pending", "in-progress", "completed")
   - `dueDate`: string (ISO 8601 format)
   - `assignedUser`: string (user ID)

3. **User Model**:
   - `id`: string (auto-generated by Firebase)
   - `name`: string
   - `email`: string
   - `role`: string (role ID)

4. **Role Model**:
   - `id`: string (auto-generated by Firebase)
   - `name`: string (e.g., "admin", "user")
   - `permissions`: array of strings (e.g., ["create_task", "update_task", "delete_task"])

5. **Tech Stack**:
   - Node.js
   - TypeScript
   - Firebase Firestore (for data storage)
   - Firebase Authentication (for user authentication)
   - Docker (for containerization)

6. **Additional Requirements**:
   - Use Firebase Authentication to secure the API. Only authenticated users should be able to access the endpoints.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
   - Provide a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- Proper use of TypeScript
- Correct implementation of RESTful principles
- Secure authentication using Firebase Authentication
- Proper use of Firebase Firestore for data storage
- Implementation of role-based access control (RBAC)
- Proper Dockerization of the application
- Clear and concise documentation

## Submission
Candidates should submit their solution as a private GitHub repository and set this account as a collaborator. The repository should include all the source code, Dockerfile, and README file with setup instructions.

## Example Task Object
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Complete coding challenge",
  "description": "Finish the backend developer coding challenge",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "dueDate": "2023-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "assignedUser": "user_123"
}
```

## Example User Object
```json
{
  "id": "user_123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "role": "role_456"
}
```

## Example Role Object
```json
{
  "id": "role_456",
  "name": "admin",
  "permissions": ["create_task", "update_task", "delete_task"]
}
```

# Instructions for Candidates
1. Fork the provided GitHub repository (if applicable) or create a new repository.
2. Implement the required API endpoints and functionality.
3. Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
4. Write a README file with setup and usage instructions.
5. Submit the link to your GitHub repository.

# Tips
- Make sure to handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
- Follow best practices for RESTful API design.
- Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and easy to understand.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your submission.
